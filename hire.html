                I'm a senior Python developer with a strong e-commerce background.
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
                My work on <a href="http://oscarcommerce.com">Oscar</a>
                teaches me how to design flexible frameworks for
                complex domains. Running a major open-source project
                together with a large and diverse community also requires good people and
                communication skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                I know how to enforce business rules while dealing with flaky APIs,
                scraped data, and asynchronous event processing.
                I care about tests &amp; documentation, rely on CI/CD for my deployments,
                and generally know my way 'round DevOps.
            </p>
